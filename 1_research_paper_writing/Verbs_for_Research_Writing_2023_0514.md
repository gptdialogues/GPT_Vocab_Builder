1. **Assert**: To state something as the case, typically without providing evidence or proof.

2. **Elucidate**: To make something clear; to explain.

3. **Garner**: To gather or collect (something, especially information or approval).

4. **Infer**: To deduce or conclude information from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements.

5. **Negate**: To make ineffective; to nullify.

6. **Peruse**: To read something in a thorough or careful way.

7. **Purport**: To appear or claim to be or do something, especially falsely.

9. **Substantiate**: To provide evidence to support or prove the truth of.

10. **Underpin**: To support, justify, or form the basis for.

11. **Vet**: To make a careful and critical examination of something.

12. **Ascertain**: To find something out for certain; make sure of.

13. **Expedite**: To make something happen sooner or more quickly.

14. **Innovate**: To make changes in something established, especially by introducing new methods, ideas, or products.

15. **Nullify**: To make legally null and void; to invalidate.

16. **Presuppose**: To tacitly assume at the beginning of a line of argument or course of action that something is the case.

17. **Reconcile**: To restore friendly relations between; to cause to coexist in harmony.

18. **Scrutinize**: To examine or inspect closely and thoroughly.

19. **Triangulate**: To use triangulation to establish the distance or position of (something).
