Please give me some useful expressions for me to use as log messages in a script.

1. Initialization and Setup:
   - "Script started successfully"
   - "Initializing variables"
   - "Loading configuration files"
   - "Setting up environment"

2. Processing and Execution:
   - "Running function/task {function/task name}"
   - "Processing data for {specific task}"
   - "Executing query with parameters: {parameters}"
   - "Running batch job {job_id} at {timestamp}"

3. Success and Completion:
   - "Data processed successfully"
   - "Task {task name} completed successfully"
   - "Function {function name} returned successfully"
   - "Script completed successfully"

4. Error Handling:
   - "Error: Failed to open file {file_name}"
   - "Exception caught in function {function_name}"
   - "Warning: Missing value for {variable}"
   - "Critical: System out of memory"
   - "Error: Unknown command {command}"

5. Debugging:
   - "Entering debug mode"
   - "Debug: Variable {variable_name} = {value}"
   - "Trace: Entering function {function_name}"
   - "Debug: Received {data} from {source}"

6. Cleanup and Shutdown:
   - "Closing database connection"
   - "Freeing up memory resources"
   - "Shutting down script"

Remember to provide as much specific and relevant information in your log messages as possible, without revealing any sensitive information. This will help significantly in debugging and understanding the behavior of your script.
