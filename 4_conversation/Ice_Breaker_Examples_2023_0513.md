Sure, I'd be happy to provide you with some examples. The best icebreakers will depend on the context, but here are some general ones you could adapt to various situations:

1. **General Icebreakers**

   - "What's your favorite way to spend the weekend?"
   - "What was the last book you read that you really enjoyed?"
   - "What's the most interesting thing you've learned recently?"

2. **Work-related Icebreakers**

   - "How did you get started in your career?"
   - "What's the most rewarding project you've worked on here?"
   - "If you could pick up a new skill in an instant what would it be?"

3. **Networking Event Icebreakers**

   - "What brings you to this event today?"
   - "What do you enjoy most about your profession?"
   - "Have you been to an event like this before?"

4. **Travel Icebreakers**

   - "What's the most amazing place you've ever visited?"
   - "If you could travel anywhere in the world right now, where would you go?"
   - "Do you prefer vacations in the city or in nature?"

5. **School/University Icebreakers**

   - "What's your favorite subject/course this semester and why?"
   - "What do you like to do when you're not studying?"
   - "If you could have any superpower to help you with your studies, what would it be?"

6. **Online Meeting Icebreakers**

   - "What's the most interesting thing you can see out of your office or kitchen window?"
   - "What's your favorite thing about working from home, if you do?"
   - "What's the most interesting virtual background you've seen in an online meeting?"

7. **Food-Related Icebreakers**

   - "What's your go-to comfort food?"
   - "If you could only eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be?"
   - "What's the best meal you've ever had?"

Remember, the goal of an icebreaker is to encourage conversation, so it's best to ask open-ended questions that can't be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'.
