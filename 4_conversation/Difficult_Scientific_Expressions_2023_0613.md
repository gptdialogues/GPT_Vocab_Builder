Please give me some expressions that are difficult to hear for non-native English speakers in scientific discussions.

Sure, in scientific discussions, there are many idiomatic expressions, jargon, and complex sentences that can be difficult to understand for non-native English speakers. Here are some examples:

1. **In the same ballpark**: Used to indicate something is roughly the same. For example, "The results of our experiment are in the same ballpark as the theory."

2. **Crunch the numbers**: A term used to describe the process of doing mathematical calculations or statistical analysis. "We'll need to crunch the numbers to confirm these results."

3. **Pushing the envelope**: This term means to test or go beyond the current limits or boundaries of a field. "Her latest research is really pushing the envelope in quantum physics."

4. **The jury is still out**: This term indicates that there is no decision or consensus on a matter. "The jury is still out on whether dark matter comprises the majority of the universe."

5. **Down to the wire**: Means something is going to the last minute or the very end. "The team was conducting experiments and analyzing data down to the wire."

6. **Game changer**: Used to describe something that significantly changes the current state of things. "The discovery of this new material could be a game changer for renewable energy."

7. **Read between the lines**: This means to understand the implicit meaning of something that is not explicitly stated. "If you read between the lines of the study, you'll see that the researchers are hinting at potential applications in biotechnology."

8. **Get the ball rolling**: To start a process or project. "Let's get the ball rolling on this research proposal."

9. **Cutting-edge**: Referring to the most advanced or innovative developments. "Their lab is doing some cutting-edge work in neural networks."

10. **Hard and fast rule**: A rule that is fixed and definitive, with no room for change. "There's no hard and fast rule about the number of trials needed in a study, it largely depends on the research design."

These are idiomatic expressions often used in discussions. The other challenge non-native speakers might face is scientific jargon â€“ specialized terms used in particular fields. For instance, in physics, words like "quarks," "dark matter," "relativity," "quantum entanglement" may be confusing if not familiar with the field. It's essential to learn the specific terminology used in the scientific field in question.

Absolutely, here are some additional common idiomatic expressions used in scientific and academic discussions:

1. **The tip of the iceberg**: Meaning only a small, often unrepresentative portion of something is being perceived. "The data we have is just the tip of the iceberg; there's so much more to investigate."

2. **Cherry pick**: To selectively choose (the most beneficial or profitable items, opportunities, etc.) from what is available. "It's not good practice to cherry pick data that supports our hypothesis while ignoring data that contradicts it."

3. **Back to square one**: To go back to the starting point, after a dead-end or failure. "The experiment failed, so we're back to square one."

4. **The devil is in the details**: The difficulties or complexities in a situation are often found in the minute details. "The overall experiment design looks solid, but the devil is in the details."

5. **Go down the rabbit hole**: To enter into a situation or begin a process or journey that is particularly strange, problematic, difficult, complex, or chaotic. "Studying quantum physics can feel like going down a rabbit hole."

6. **On the same wavelength**: Thinking in a similar way or understanding each other well. "I'm glad our team is on the same wavelength about the research approach."

7. **Peaks and valleys**: This is used to describe the ups and downs or highs and lows. "The peaks and valleys of the graph indicate a cyclical pattern."

8. **Turn over a new leaf**: To make a fresh start or change your behavior in a positive way. "After the failed experiment, the team decided to turn over a new leaf and design a more controlled study."

9. **Hit the nail on the head**: To describe exactly what is causing a situation or problem. "Your hypothesis about the reaction mechanism really hit the nail on the head."

10. **Keep your ear to the ground**: To keep informed about the latest developments. "Keep your ear to the ground about the latest breakthroughs in molecular biology."

Remember, while idioms can add color and flavor to language, they are often metaphorical and not literal. So understanding the context and culture of the language is important when learning idioms.
